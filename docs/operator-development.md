# Multimodal Operator Development Guide

## Purpose

This guide defines how to develop and review operators in `daft-mmops`.
Operators currently run on Daft and turn input records into enriched 1:1
records for multimodal preprocessing, inference, and annotation.

For installation and user-facing examples, see [README.md](../README.md).
Automated contributors must also follow [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).

## Choose an execution shape

| Workload | Recommended API |
|---|---|
| Lightweight independent transform | standalone `@mmops.row` |
| Arrow-vectorized transform | standalone `@mmops.batch` |
| Reusable model, tokenizer, codec, or client | `@mmops.operator` class |
| Low-latency and high-throughput forms of one model | row and batch methods on one class |
| Network-bound annotation | async row or batch method with bounded concurrency |

Use `def` or `async def` to express synchronous or asynchronous behavior. Row
or batch grain belongs on each method, not on `@mmops.operator`; one class may
therefore expose several row and batch entrypoints.

Methods without `@mmops.row` or `@mmops.batch` are internal helpers and are not
exposed to Daft.

## Public API conventions

- Do not declare an input schema on the decorator. The Python signature and
  call site bind column expressions and literal arguments.
- Row `return_dtype` is optional when Daft can infer it from the return type.
- Batch `return_dtype` is required and must be a `pyarrow.DataType`.
- Use `return_dtype`, `batch_size`, `max_retries`, and `on_error` names.
- Use `Resources(cpus=..., gpus=..., memory_bytes=...)` for resource requests.
- Put Daft-only escape hatches under `backend_options["daft"]`.

### Row template

```python
import mmops


@mmops.row
def normalize(text: str) -> str:
    return text.strip().lower()
```

Add an explicit Arrow dtype when the Python annotation cannot express the
required precision, fixed size, nullability, or struct layout:

```python
import pyarrow as pa


@mmops.row(return_dtype=pa.list_(pa.float32()))
def embed_one(text: str) -> list[float]:
    return model.embed(text)
```

### Batch template

```python
import pyarrow as pa
import pyarrow.compute as pc

import mmops


@mmops.batch(return_dtype=pa.int64(), batch_size=256)
def text_length(text: pa.Array) -> pa.Array:
    return pc.cast(pc.utf8_length(text), pa.int64())
```

Batch parameters are one or more `pa.Array` values plus ordinary literals.
Batch output must be exactly one `pa.Array` with the declared dtype.

### Stateful template

```python
import pyarrow as pa

import mmops


@mmops.operator(
    resources=mmops.Resources(gpus=1),
    max_concurrency=4,
)
class Embedder:
    def __init__(self, model_path: str):
        self.model = load_model(model_path)

    @mmops.row(return_dtype=pa.list_(pa.float32()))
    async def embed_one(self, text: str) -> list[float]:
        return await self.model.embed(text)

    @mmops.batch(
        return_dtype=pa.list_(pa.float32()),
        batch_size=64,
    )
    async def embed_batch(self, text: pa.Array) -> pa.Array:
        return await self.model.embed_batch(text)
```

Initialize models and clients in `__init__`. Daft lazily creates and reuses the
instance in a worker/actor. Constructor validation and initialization errors
therefore appear when an entrypoint is first invoked, not when the client-side
operator handle is created.

## Batch data contract

Version 1 has strict 1:1 cardinality: every input row produces one output row.

Batch entrypoints must:

- accept `pa.Array`, not `daft.Series`;
- return `pa.Array` or its `pa.StructArray` subtype;
- return the same number of rows as the input arrays;
- return the exact declared dtype;
- preserve documented null semantics;
- handle empty and final short batches;
- avoid whole-batch `to_pylist()` conversion when Arrow kernels or buffer
  interfaces can perform the operation.

Do not return `pa.Table`, `pa.RecordBatch`, `pa.ChunkedArray`, Pandas objects,
NumPy arrays, Python lists, or `daft.Series`. If a model or external service
requires Python objects, document the conversion and its expected cost.

The framework treats top-level `string`/`large_string` and
`binary`/`large_binary` as logically compatible because Daft may normalize
Arrow offset widths. Nested types and all other dtypes must match exactly.

### Multiple output columns

One UDF invocation returns one logical Arrow array. Use a struct dtype and
`unnest=True` for several named output columns:

```python
result_type = pa.struct(
    [
        pa.field("embedding", pa.list_(pa.float32())),
        pa.field("score", pa.float32()),
    ]
)


@mmops.batch(return_dtype=result_type, unnest=True)
def analyze(text: pa.Array) -> pa.StructArray:
    embeddings, scores = run_model(text)
    return pa.StructArray.from_arrays(
        [embeddings, scores],
        fields=list(result_type),
    )
```

Treat field names and types as public API. Names must describe the computed
value accurately.

## Row and batch consistency

When the same capability has row and batch entrypoints, align:

- output dtype and field names;
- null and empty-input behavior;
- error behavior;
- literal option defaults;
- ordering guarantees.

Do not rely on global row order for asynchronous Daft execution unless the
operator explicitly guarantees it.

## State semantics

Operator state is local to one Daft worker/actor instance. It is suitable for
expensive initialization and connection reuse, not for:

- cross-worker shared state;
- keyed routing or ordering;
- checkpoint/restore;
- exactly-once processing;
- a guaranteed teardown callback.

Keep credentials, access tokens, and environment-specific endpoints out of
source code and serialized operator metadata.

## Daft integration boundary

Operator business code uses Python scalars and PyArrow arrays. Daft integration
is implemented centrally in `src/mmops/backends/daft.py` with public APIs only:

- `daft.func` and `daft.func.batch`;
- `daft.cls`;
- `daft.method` and `daft.method.batch`.

Do not use private APIs such as `Func._from_func`, `mark_cls_method`, or
`daft.udf.udf_v2` internals. Never silently discard an explicitly requested
execution option; raise `DaftCompatibilityError` when the installed Daft
version cannot represent it.

Definitions and constructed operator handles must remain pickleable across
Daft worker boundaries without serializing locks or client-side caches.

The current release executes only through Daft. Keep execution bindings
isolated internally so another engine can be evaluated later, but do not expose
or document an unimplemented engine as supported.

## Package and dependency organization

Reusable operators live under `src/mmops/operators/`. As the catalog grows,
group cohesive capabilities by domain:

```text
src/mmops/operators/
├── text/
├── image/
├── audio/
├── video/
├── document/
└── multimodal/
```

Do not add empty directory scaffolding. Create a domain package when real
operators form a useful group.

Keep the core package lightweight. Heavy model, media, codec, or service SDKs
belong in optional extras and should be imported only by the relevant domain
module or execution path. Users must not need to rebuild Daft or edit installed
Daft source code.

Each planned modality has a same-named extra in `pyproject.toml`. Extras for
modalities without production operators remain empty and are documented as
reserved, not supported. When the first operator is released, add the Daft
runtime and any modality dependencies to that extra. The `all` extra must equal
the flattened dependency union of `text`, `image`, `audio`, `video`,
`document`, and `multimodal`; PEP 621 extras cannot reference one another by
name. Update the modality extra, `all`, README installation table, and
packaging tests in the same change as a new operator dependency.

Each production operator must document:

- accepted input representation;
- output dtype and field meanings;
- null and failure behavior;
- optional dependencies, model, or service requirements;
- CPU, GPU, memory, batch-size, and concurrency expectations;
- runtime credentials or configuration without exposing their values.

## Testing requirements

Every new operator needs:

- eager Python or Arrow tests;
- a real Daft DataFrame integration test;
- null behavior coverage;
- empty input coverage when applicable;
- final-short-batch coverage when `batch_size` is set;
- output dtype and field-name assertions;
- row/batch consistency coverage when both forms exist;
- error-path coverage for the public contract.

Run the repository verification commands listed in
[AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md#tests-and-verification) before completion.

## Review checklist

- The operator solves a reusable multimodal processing or annotation task.
- Its public name and output fields accurately describe its behavior.
- Row and batch signatures follow the scalar/Arrow contract.
- Batch output has the declared dtype and preserves 1:1 cardinality.
- Null, empty, error, and ordering semantics are explicit and tested.
- Expensive resources initialize in `__init__`, not at module import.
- Optional dependencies do not affect unrelated imports.
- Secrets are supplied at runtime and are not logged or serialized.
- Resource and concurrency expectations are documented.
- Public exports, README/operator docs, and tests change together.
